# PlayerReports

## A report plugin allowing players easy reporting and giving staff all active reports in a GUI

This Player Report system allows all or specific players to report rule breakers found on your server. Upon creating a
report, the system notifies all online staff that a new report has been made. Staff members can view the report within a
GUI containing all active player reports. Here, the staff member can teleport to the suspected rule breaker or close out
the report entirely. All the chat messages in this plugin are 100% customizable.
